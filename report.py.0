        (ii) The entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of the transactions 
        contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and 
        will not result in the violation of any of the terms and provisions of the constituting 
        documents or articles of association of the Borrower or any indenture or other agreement, 
        written or oral, to which the Borrower may be a party or otherwise bound.

    notwithstanding any investigations made by or on behalf of the parties hereto.

6. DEFAULT. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the principal Loan Amount 
advanced  shall, at the option of the Lender, become immediately due and payable in each and 
every of the following events:
    (i) if the Borrower makes any default in the payment of any indebtedness or obligation 
    to the Lender or defaults in repayment of the principal Loan Amount payable under this 
    Agreement and such default is not remedied within ten (10) days of the Borrower receiving 
    notice in writing from the Lender of the default;

    Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act or goes into liquidation, either voluntarily or under 
    an order by a court of competent jurisdiction, or makes a general assignment for 
    the benefit of its creditors or otherwise acknowledges itself insolvent; and 
    (iv) if the Borrower abandons its undertaking or ceases or threatens to cease to carry 
    on Business or threatens to commit any act of bankruptcy.

Provided that it shall not be an Event of Default if an inability to make any payment 
required pursuant to this Agreement is a result of an error incurred by a Bitcoin Exchange 
Operator. Should such a delay occur, the parties will negotiate alternative payment 
options. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on an alternative payment 
method, either Party may refer the matter to arbitration by providing the other Party with 
a notice to proceed to arbitrate (\"Notice of Arbitration\"). Upon either Party providing 
a Notice of Arbitration, the matter (or such matters as remain in dispute, if the Parties 
agree they have resolved some but not all of the original dispute) shall not later than 
thirty (30) days from issuance of the Notice of Arbitration be submitted to final and binding 
arbitration in accordance with the Nova Scotia Commercial Arbitration Act. Any matter in 
dispute that is submitted for arbitration shall be heard by a single arbitrator chosen by 
the Parties. The cost of the arbitration, excluding a Party's legal fees and disbursements 
shall, unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator or the panel, be borne equally by the 
Parties. The Lender agrees that the Borrower may, at its discretion, include such other 
creditors of the Borrower as may be affected by the Bitcoin Exchange Operator error in 
the foregoing arbitration.

Amount provided that no sum in excess of one half of the Loan Amount then outstanding, and
