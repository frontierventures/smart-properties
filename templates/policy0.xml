We make the website, www.coingig.com (the “Website”) available to you as your platform for buying and selling products (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users through the Website and/or Services.</p>

        <h2>CONSENT</h2>
        <p>By using the Website you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don’t sell customer lists. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Website and/or the Services.</p>
        <p>Please note that your use of the Website and any services are also governed by our Terms of Service which can be read at any time by clicking here.</p>

        <h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement and to address issues like malicious use of the Services. We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on registering with the Website and will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.</p>
        <p>Two types of information may be collected on the Website: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).</p>
        <p>"Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some instances you may not be able to register to use the Website or be able to access and use the Website at all. In other instances, your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be able to use certain features of the Website.</p>
        <p>We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through registration processes; communications with you; product purchases; user support; and surveys.</p>
        <p>"Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the website. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.</p>
        <p>Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website. Such Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie when you choose to visit the Website.</p>

        <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We collect information for the following purposes:</p>
        <p>Registration: In order to buy and/or sell products, you must create an account for the Website. To create an account you are required to provide certain information, such as your name and email address. You will also be asked to choose a user name and password. During the registration process, you will be given an opportunity to provide certain optional information. This optional information will be used in and may be displayed as part of your account. When this information is collected, the information that is mandatory and the information that is optional will be clearly identified. You will also be told which information will be maintained in confidence and which information may be disclosed as part of your member profile. In general, none of your account registration information will be shared with any other users of the Website by us.</p>
        <p>Transactional Notifications: We also provide notifications for the activities you engage in on the Website such as unsubscribing, registration confirmations, notifications of new private messages, confirmation of account setting changes and notification of new contacts. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Statistics: we also collect statistics about goods and services that are purchased through the website. This information will be kept confidential, however, aggregate statistics that do not personally identify an individual will be kept by us and such aggregate statistics may be made available to other members or third parties.</p>
        <p>System Logs and Cookies: Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website. A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. The Website uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this website, such as how many users visit the Website, how long users spend viewing the Website, and what pages are viewed most often. This information is used to improve the content of the Website. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the Website. We do not link any of the information we use in cookies to any personally identifiable information submitted by you when you are on the Website.</p>
        <p>Your IP address is reported by your web browser whenever you visit a page on the Website. This information is recorded together with your registration information on our databases. We use this to:</p>
        <p>Diagnose problems and any issues reported by other users that are related to the IP addresses controlled by specific parties.</p>
        <p>Gauge how many users are visiting the Website from different geographical regions and using the Services.</p>
        <p>Trace back the source of any malicious or illegal use of the Services so that we can more easily track and disable such usage as it arises.</p>
        <p>Advertisements: Advertisements appearing on this Website may be delivered to visitors or members by us or one or more third-party web advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by Us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers. For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).</p>
        <p>Web Beacons: Some pages on the Website may contain electronic images known as web beacons. A Web beacon is a graphic image, often no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a website and used to monitor the behavior of users visiting the website. When the html code for a web beacon points to a website that is to be used to retrieve a message, then, as part of this retrieval process, information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that was used to retrieve the image and previously set cookie values may be passed along to that website. We use web beacons to target advertisements, provide aggregated reports for advertisers, to count users who have visited those pages or to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access Personal Information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about the website. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. For the privacy practices of third-party web advertisers in respect to web beacons or any cookies that such third party advertisers may place on your computer, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for that third-party web advertiser.</p>
        <p>Content: We may distribute your reviews and other content posted on the Website to third parties, as permitted pursuant to our Terms of Service. You understand that your comments may identify you and/or link back to your account on the Website.</p>
